# Topics in the phonology of Uralic

## Class 1: intro to Uralic

- Finno-Ugric entity is not real
- Introduce minority languages
- Influences on minority Uralic from Russian
- Lay out the typology of the phonological phenomena to review: consonant gradation, prosody and its effects, vowel inventories

## Class 2: consonant gradation

- Dataset: Estonian problem
- What is gradation; definitions of targets, triggers and grades, variety of phonetic realisation
- Examples from Uralic and non-Uralic
- How Uralic gradation stands out: the morphophonological nature, distant trigger
- Possibly introduce the Saami dataset

## Class 3: Khanty stress and vowel-zero alternations

- Dataset: Khanty schwa + stress
- Problems with schwa as epenthesis
- Three kinds of schwa: exponents, characterisation of allophones, representations of morphemes
- What role does the stress play? Unstressed schwa is invisible schwa

## Class 4: Moksha: quality-conditioned stress

- The problem: syllable-counting rules
- The stress rule -- quality-dependent BAP
- Stress to rescue syllable-counting rules and (possibly) phonologically conditioned allomorphy

## Vowel quality and Forest Nenets

- Dataset of Salminen's examples
- SHOULD BE UPDATED AFTER FIELDWORK !!! 
- Salminen's (2007) peculiar underlying schwa
- Appropriate representation of long vowels and schwa
- Analyse the quality alternations
