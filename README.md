# Topics in the phonology of Uralic

This is the repository for the class about the phonology of Uralic languages at EGG2023. It contains several case studies that illustrate several phonological phenomena as they occur in Uralic languages by introducing datasets from prominent European languages such as Finnish or Estonian, as well as from minority languages such as Moksha, Kazym Khanty and Forest Nenets.
